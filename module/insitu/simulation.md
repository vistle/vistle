[Simulation]() modules provide a direct link to a simulation that is still on-going. They enable acquiring data from running simulations for in situ processing, bypassing file I/O.
Together with [Read]() modules they provide the sources of the workflow.
Interfaces to several in situ visualization frameworks are provided. Currently, this comprises [Catalyst 2](https://catalyst-in-situ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [VisIt](https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/)'s [libsim](https://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Simulation_Control_Interface).
