Vistle - A Modular Data-Parallel Visualization System
=====================================================

> **vistle**:

License
-------

Vistle source code is licensed under the LGPL v2.1. See `LICENSE.txt` for details. This does not apply to the subdirectory `lib/3rdparty`.


Installation
------------

### Installing with [Spack](https://spack.io)

  Add the [HLRS Vis Spack repository](https://github.com/hlrs-vis/spack-hlrs-vis) to your installation of Spack:

      git clone https://github.com/hlrs-vis/spack-hlrs-vis
      spack repo add spack-hlrs-vis

  Then you can install Vistle with this command:

      spack install vistle


### macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

  Install most of Vistle's dependencies by invoking `brew bundle` within Vistle's root source directory. You can also install Vistle with

      brew install hlrs-vis/tap/vistle


### Installing From Source

#### Build Requirements

- **C++ compiler**:
  support for C++14 (ISO/IEC 14882:2014) is required,
  known good compilers:
    - GCC (8-13)
    - Clang (Xcode 14, 15)
    - Microsoft Visual Studio 2022

- **CMake**:
  at least 3.10, on Windows 3.15

- **MPI**:
  Microsoft MPI, Open MPI, MPICH and MVAPICH2 has been used successfully.

- **Boost**:
  At least 1.59.00 is required.
     Notes:
     - in order to switch MPI implementations without requiring a recompilation of Boost, we compile Boost.MPI together with Vistle

- Botan:
  [Crypto and TLS for Modern C++](https://botan.randombit.net/) is used for verifying HMACs during connection establishment,
  version 1, 2 or 3 should work

- **Python**:
  for interpreting Vistle scripts (.vsl), Python 3 should work.

- **COVISE/OpenCOVER**:
  OpenCOVER or a version of COVISE including OpenCOVER compiled by you is necessary, get it from
  [GitHub](https://github.com/hlrs-vis/covise), needed for the COVER module and COVER plug-ins
  You can shorten the build process and cut down on dependencies by [building only OpenCOVER](https://github.com/hlrs-vis/covise#building-only-opencover).
  In addition you should set `COVISEDESTDIR` to a location where compiled COVER plug-ins should go.
      Hints:
      - The COVISE repository contains further information on how to build dependencies on Linux ([README-Building-deps-linux.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlrs-vis/covise/master/README-Building-deps-linux.txt)) and Windows ([README-Building-deps.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlrs-vis/covise/master/README-Building-deps.txt)).

- **OpenSceneGraph**:
  the version of OpenSceneGraph that was used for compiling OpenCOVER

- **Qt**:
  The Qt 5 libraries `Qt5Core`, `Qt5Widgets` and `Qt5Gui` are required by the graphical user interface,
  alternatively also Qt 6 can be used.

You can set the environment variable `EXTERNLIBS` to a directory where Vistle should search for 3rd party libraries. It will search in e.g. `$EXTERNLIBS/boost`, if CMake is looking for `Boost`.


#### Getting Vistle

Getting Vistle is as easy as

      git clone --recursive https://github.com/vistle/vistle.git

If you need to update an existing working copy, then change to its directory and issue the following commands:

      git submodule sync --recursive
      git submodule update --init --recursive

#### Building Vistle

Create a subdirectory for building, change to it, and invoke CMake:

      cmake ..

Then build with your build tool, e.g.:

      make -j20


Invoking Vistle
---------------

### Environment Set-Up

Vistle modules are run on clusters via MPI. You have to configure how they have to be spawned by providing a script named `spawn_vistle.sh` (or `spawn_vistle.bat` on Windows) somewhere in your `PATH`. It could be as simple as

      #! /usr/bin/env bash
      mpirun "$@"

But it also might require invoking your batch system. An example is provided in `vistle/bin`.

For COVER to find its plug-ins, you should add the directory from `COVISEDESTDIR` to `COVISE_PATH`.

### Command Line Switches

Synopsis:

      vistle [--batch|--gui|--tui] [scriptfile]

Options:

* `-b`|`--batch`:
  do not start a user interface

* `-g`|`--gui` (default):
  start a graphical user interface on rank 0

* `-t`|`--tui`:
  start a command line user interface on rank 0

You can connect a user interface to a running Vistle session later on, e.g.:

      vistle_gui localhost 31093
