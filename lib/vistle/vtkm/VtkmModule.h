/**
 * @class VtkmModule
 * @brief Base class for VTK-m modules which allow the execution of algorithms on different device backends,
 *        including GPUs.
 *
 * By default, a VTK-m module consists of one input port and one output port. If additional ports are needed, 
 * the parent constructor can be called with the desired number (`numPorts`). Note that all data on the ports 
 * must be defined on the same grid.
 * 
 * The base behavior of a VTK-m module is as follows (see `compute()`):
 * The VTK-m module reads in the data on the input port(s) and transforms it into a VTK-m dataset. A VTK-m filter,
 * which uses the data on the first port as active field, is then applied to the dataset. The result is transformed
 * back to Vistle objects and finally written to the output port(s).
 * 
 * Child classes must implement the `setUpFilter` method, which defines the desired VTK-m filter. If the filter
 * only operates on the input grid, `m_requireMappedData` can be set to `false` when calling the parent constructor. 
 * Additional module parameters can be added in the child's constructor. 
 * 
 * Optionally, the child classes can override the `prepareInputGrid` and `prepareInputField` methods to add checks 
 * on the input data, before transforming it into the VTK-m format. `prepareOutputGrid` and `prepareOutputField`
 * can be overridden, if desired, to change the output grid or field(s) that will be added to the output
 * port(s).
